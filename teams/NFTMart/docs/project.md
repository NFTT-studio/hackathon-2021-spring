# NFTMart info

## Background

Starting from 2017, the NFT market has only 3 years of history so far, which is very immature compared to Bitcoin (11 years) or the traditional 
financial market (hundreds of years). As an on-chain mapping of the real economy, the market size of NFT will be much larger than the FT Token 
market. The current monthly transaction amount is only about 10 million US dollars, which is less than one hundred thousandth of the FT Token 
market. Even with a conservative attitude toward the development of NFTs, there will be hundreds or even thousands of times the market size 
growth space in the next two to three years.
